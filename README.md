# AlexNet
AlexNet was designed by Hinton, winner of the 2012 ImageNet competition, and his student Alex Krizhevsky. It was also after that year that more and deeper neural networks were proposed, such as the excellent vgg, GoogleLeNet. Its official data model has an accuracy rate of 57.1% and top 1-5 reaches 80.2%. This is already quite outstanding for traditional machine learning classification algorithms.
